# NutrientCalc
Nutrition calculator webapp

This is a nutrient calculator for people who would like to monitor the nutritional content of their diet. It is particularly useful for people who are trying to maintain a specific diet, such as keto, Atkins, etc. when used for menu planning.

This application uses multiple sources of data, the largest being the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 27. We include as much information as possible about each item so that users can select whatever data is of particular interest to them while ignoring the rest. We don't advocate any particular diet or nutrition philosophy, but hope this tool is useful for a wide range users.

Currently this is a mobile-friendly webapp for use in modern browsers; in the future it may be ported to run as a native app on other platforms such as Android.
